    "1. Ask users to input the preceding quarter’s RPPR2 (if the award isn’t new) as well as the current RPPR2 so that we can check for cumulative updates.\n",

    "    1. If one column is calculated from another, check that the calculation is executing properly\n",
    "    2. Start and end dates should be earlier and later than one another, resp.\n",
    "    3. Define what columns are required in order to do even a partial data save on a given column\n",

    "# The Plan of Action\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the template RPPR2\n",
    "    * How to first inspect the tab names and tab count? Pandas won't do that automatically I think...\n",
    "    * If you can count tabs only, return error if tab count is off, otherwise name the tabs that weren't expected as erroneous\n",
    "2. Use the template to define: \n",
    "    * What the list of proper tab names and count are\n",
    "    * The size of the header above column names\n",
    "    * Column names, number, and dtypes\n",
    "    * For Accomplishments tab (only, I think?): Column EOL indicators so you know when you're seeing a new category\n",
    "3. Pull in the n-1 RPPR2 (if not a new award) and the current RPPR2\n",
    "    1. Compare the two and make sure older data didn't disappear in newer RPPR2\n",
    "    2. Check the current RPPR2 for compliance with template requirements\n",
    "    3. If non-compliant, print out diagnostic report for everything obvious that you found\n",
    "        * Include a line for non-equivalency that you may not have a pre-defined rule for and flag it in a separate repo file that can be referenced later for improving the code (a log file will work for this)\n",
    "            * Lack of equivalency can be checked very thoroughly using `dataframe.equals(other_df)`, but it actually checks for identical elements too. Good thing to do for making sure you got two different RPPR2s, but otherwise need a more complicated check since we don't expect the same elements each time...quite the opposite in fact! \n",
    "            * Might need to just check `dataframe.columns` for proper number and names of columns to start with"
