# RPPR-2 Checker
The U.S. Department of Energy's Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) utilizes a variety of documents for projects it funds to report on their current status. One such document is the RPPR-2 spreadsheet. This tool checks the RPPR-2 .XLSX file to see if it complies with SETO's template requirements file.


## Typical Way of Using This Tool
This tool check to see if the input spreadsheet meets SETO's formatting requirements as laid out in their RPPR-2 template file, which is also included in this repository. If the input file does not meet these requirements, a diagnostic report is provided regarding what elements need to be fixed in order to be in compliance.
